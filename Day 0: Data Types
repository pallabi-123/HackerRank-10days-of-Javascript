Overview: 10 Days of JavaScript
This series focuses on learning and practicing JavaScript. Each challenge comes with a tutorial article, and you can view these articles by clicking either the Topics tab along the top or the article icon in the right-hand menu.

Objective

In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. Check out the tutorial to learn more about JavaScript's lexical structure.

Task

A greeting function is provided for you in the editor below. It has one parameter, parameter variable . Perform the following tasks to complete this challenge:

1) Use console.log() to print Hello, World! on a new line in the console, which is also known as stdout or standard output. 
   The code for this portion of the task is already provided in the editor.
2) Use console.log() to print the contents of parameter variable (i.e., the argument passed to main).
You've got this!

Input Format

Data Type	     Parameter	                                      Description
string		  parameter variable                        A single line of text containing one or more space-separated words.

Output Format

Print the following two lines of output:

On the first line, print Hello, World! (this is provided for you in the editor).
On the second line, print the contents of .

Sample Input 0

Welcome to 10 Days of JavaScript!

Sample Output 0

Hello, World!
Welcome to 10 Days of JavaScript!

Explanation 0

We printed two lines of output:

1)We printed the literal string Hello, World! using the code provided in the editor.
2)The value of parameter variable passed to our main function in this Sample Case was Welcome to 10 Days of JavaScript!. We then passed our variable to console.log, 
which printed the contents of parameter variable.






/**
*   The variables 'firstInteger', 'firstDecimal', and 'firstString' are declared for you -- do not modify them.
*   Print three lines:
*   1. The sum of 'firstInteger' and the Number representation of 'secondInteger'.
*   2. The sum of 'firstDecimal' and the Number representation of 'secondDecimal'.
*   3. The concatenation of 'firstString' and 'secondString' ('firstString' must be first).
*
*	Parameter(s):
*   secondInteger - The string representation of an integer.
*   secondDecimal - The string representation of a floating-point number.
*   secondString - A string consisting of one or more space-separated words.

        console.log(firstString.concat(secondString));
