Objective
In this challenge, we use a Regular Expression to evaluate a string. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task
Complete the function in the editor below by returning a RegExp object, re, that matches any string s that begins and ends with the same vowel. 
Recall that the English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u.

Constraints
The length of string s is â‰¥ 3 .
String s consists of lowercase letters only (i.e., [a-z]).

Output Format
The function must return a RegExp object that matches any string  beginning with and ending in the same vowel.

Explanation 3
This string starts with the vowel a but ends in the vowel o.


function regexVar() {
    /*
     * Declare a RegExp object variable named 're'
     * It must match a string that starts and ends with the same vowel (i.e., {a, e, i, o, u})
     */
    
     var re = RegExp(/^([aeiou]).*\1$/);
    /*
     * Do not remove the return statement
     */
    return re;
}
